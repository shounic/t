     <p><strong>## document ##</strong></p>
    <p>the player "Hardened Zver" has been permanently banned from shounic trenches.</p>
    <p>this choice may come as a surprise to the community, so this document is being created for the benefit of informing everyone of the circumstances. please read through the entire document and please share any information disclosed here should you spot any misrepresentations or falsehoods regarding the nature of the ban. thank you</p>
    <br>
    <p>there are several factors that have culminated into this ban. below is an enumeration of them in no particular order. none of the following reasons are the entire justification for the ban, and the totality of the situation needs to be considered.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>## factor 1: inexplicable player behaviors</strong></p>
    <p>background context: on November 20th, "Hardened Zver" was warned for his behavior in attempting to subvert the server's systems at attempting to create balanced matches. Zver would very frequently take advantage of situations where his team had more players than the other team to swap over, such that he would be able to play on the same team as individuals he believed to also be good players.</p>
    <p>the warning given was for him to stop attempting to abuse this in any capacity, or face a permanent ban from the server. (though this is not the crime he is being punished for today)</p>
    <p>in addition to the warning given out, a plugin was developed specifically because of Zver's abuse of the system, to block any players from using the team menu to swap teams during the game.</p>
    <p>with this explicit disapproval of team swapping as evidenced with the introduction of this plugin, players who were spotted attempting to circumvent this by disconnecting then rejoining the server, usually through the console command "retry", were given warnings and made aware that further abuse would lead to permanent bans.</p>
    <br>
    <p>problem at hand: players, usually, those that primarily play medic, who are sympathetic and interested in healing Zver, seemingly directed by Zver, would take advantage of the means mentioned above to swap their team to Zver's instead.</p>
    <p>in addition to this, players have been discovered to be creating new steam accounts, or using existing alternate steam accounts to avoid punishment in order to team stack with Zver. our basis for this claim come from comparing IP addresses. there are multiple steam accounts that connect to the server with the same IP address. the use of a VPN is ruled out due to the IP being residential.</p>
    <p>observe the following example:</p>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/9bXDnHv.png'>
    <p>this IP address originates from a local ISP, and unregistered for any services.</p>
    <p>now compare this to the IP address of the trenches server or shounic's private test server:</p>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/6t4DWt3.png'>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/TsMD5U9.png'>
    <p>observe the ISP listed is a business entity instead of a local ISP's name and the services registered.</p>
    <p>now, the server logs & a snippet of gameplay:</p>

    <p><strong>## factor 2: statistical curiosities</strong></p>
    <p>as part of the (poor) effort to create an automated match balancing system, data on player performance is gathered.</p>
    <p>through this, observe the data upon Hardened Zver, first on</p>
    <p>topic 1: his kill death ratio:</p>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/p99yIaY.png'>
    <p>across 767 rounds played, Zver has 25935	kills and 2336 deaths. this is a kill death ratio of 11.1</p>
    <p>to contextualize, this is the table produced if we sort by all time kills:</p>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/JQWogH3.png'>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>topic 2: winrate percentage</p>
    <p>of the data we currently retain, (we periodically delete sufficiently old records), Hardened Zver has played over 767 rounds. within these 767 rounds, he has attained a 0.701434, so 70.1% winrate. also recall that team swapping was disabled for the vast majority of this data.</p>
    <p>sorting all data we still retain by all time rounds played, the following table is produced:</p>
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/Pyy9mS5.png'>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>here is the entire data set. every entry currently retained can be found here:</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>## factor 3: curious gameplay</strong></p>
    <p>observe the following exhibits which depict the first person perspective gameplay of Hardened Zver. the footage is recorded from the pov of a spectator, so any spies, for example, are not 100% invisible and simply very transparent instead. do not mistake that for the spy being visible, in a shimmering state, which occurs when opposing players bump into them. please excuse the length of any clips shown, but understand that extraneous footage is provided to supply ample context and transparency:</p>
      <br>
      <p>exhibit A:</p>

      <p>0:44 | what is he shooting?</p>

      <p>0:04 | how is he able to react to the demo jumping in time to direct him? why is he not shooting the floor, which he does in the subsequent shot?</p>
      <br>
      <p>exhibit C:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpUAl_Ab7k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>0:01 | what is he shooting?</p>
    <br>
      <p>exhibit D:</p>

      <p>0:13 | is this how to spy check?</p>
      <br>
      <p>exhibit E:</p>

      <p>0:00 | is this how to spy check?</p>

      <p>exhibit F:</p>

      <p>0:11 | the aim is quite impressive</p>
    <p>going frame by frame, such as by means of the comma and period keyboard keys, why does the crosshair move up towards the blue character in the back, before following the spy in the foreground? the control and movement of the mouse is very very very very precise here?</p>
      <br>
      <p>exhibit G:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3W-WqhfgeyE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>0:27 | unaffected by any knockback or viewangle impairment, why did he shoot the wall?</p>
    <br>
      <p>exhibit H:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/60-CjWpSfX4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>0:23 | is this how to spy check?</p>
      <br>
    <p>granted, snippets of gameplay are not entirely reliable and serve as a poor basis to form opinions and consensus upon. therefore several entire match pov's of Hardened Zver is available for viewing:</p>

    <p>--- a second opinion:</p>
    <p>from a former competitive tf2 anti cheat admin ---</p>
    <p>"sappho — 12/12/2023 3:49 AM</p>
<p>[3:50 AM]  my verdict is that he's cheating</p>
<p>[3:50 AM]  probably crit bucketing</p>
<p>[3:50 AM]  probably short range esping</p>
<p>[3:51 AM]  he holds his rockets pretty well</p>
<p>[3:51 AM]  waiting for somneone to be just around the corner"</p>

    <p><strong>## closing</strong></p>
    <p>hopefully the position taken to ban this individual is self-explanatory and the community understands the thought process taken to arrive here. thank you for reading. </p>
